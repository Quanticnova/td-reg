With this repository you can replicate the LQR and single/double pendulum experiments.  
Some algorithms require the [Optimization Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/optimization.html).  
Some utility functions are imported from [File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/) (original authors are always acknowledged).
